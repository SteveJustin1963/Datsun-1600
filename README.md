## In 1914 the first Datsun was born, 
``` 
Without the Nissan name, Datsun, they mourn,
50 years on, hard work, less rust add paint some parts, 
Everyday day another 510 is reborn and it won't fall apart!
Some say they're nice, while others burn rice,
But when the light turns green, that engine is mean!
Ready set go, rumble dont stumble, tires smoke thick and white,
Girls beam, crowds scream, watch you go!
You crave one, any will do, day and night.
```



## Leave no man behind !
```
We set out to restore a legend,
A car that's meant to last,
A Datsun 1600 we'd refurbish,
And make it fast.

With each bolt tightened, every gear shifted,
We breathe life back into this machine,
Transforming it into a marvel,
That will leave all others green.

We'll add speed and power, grace and style,
Making it a car reborn,
And in the process, we'll reclaim,
A part of automotive lore.

So now we proudly stand beside,
This car that's built to race,
With upgraded engines, brakes, and tires,
It's ready to win the chase.

A modern classic, it'll roll down roads,
With the same spirit that it had,
And as a symbol of our passion,
It will always be remembered as a "Rad."
